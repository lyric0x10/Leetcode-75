# LeetCode 75 Challenge - C++ Solutions

Tracking my daily progress through the LeetCode 75 in this repo.

## 🚀 Goals
- I'm trying to get better at my problem-solving skills before I start my biggest project yet in C++
- Because these are my first C++ projects, I'm trying to write clean, maintainable code
- This is only my second repo, so I'm also trying to build a strong portfolio

## 📅 How I'm doing it
- Solve 3 problems
- Only C++
- Trying to learn why it works, not just mindlessly get the solution.
